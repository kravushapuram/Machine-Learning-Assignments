# Machine Learning Assignments
 Basic hands on code for python and machine learning assignments
 
Assignment 1:
 Hands-on on lists, dictionary, set, tuple.
 Basic math operations, string operations, distance measure.
 
Assignment 2:
 Hands-on on numpy - array initialization, reshape.
 Hands-on on pandas - read csv, describe data, find and fill na, aggregate, filter, drop, change column type, scatter plot
 Hands-on on matplotlib - pyplot, pie chart

Assignment 3:
 Hands-on on machine learning modeling - data understanding(correlations and plots), data preparation(on titanic dataset, glass dataset), modeling(4 variants of naive bayes, 2 of SVC), evaluation(accuracy, classification_report).
 
Assignment 4:
 Hands-on on LinearRegression and KMeans clustering(number of cluster selection with elbow method).

Assignment 5:
 Hands-on on dimensionality reduction with PCA, LDA. Understand its significance by applying KMeans and SVM on transformed data to observe the accuracy.
